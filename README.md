# Bookshelf speakers
Plans and progress of a set of bookshelf speakers from scratch (minus electronics)

# Inspiration
Many moons ago, I came across [Paul Carmody's DIY Speaker Pages](https://sites.google.com/site/undefinition/). I'm by no means a hi-fidelity audiophile but I wanted some bookshelf speakers that had quality sound as well as some character (I've had some blah Sony's before and they just don't do anything for me). Paul's page seemed like a great introduction to the craft, especially the electronics part of it, which I've always been interested in. The [Classix II](https://sites.google.com/site/undefinition/bookshelf-speakers/classix-ii?authuser=0) caught my eye because, again, I'm no audiophile, and the "economy" version was probably going to do me just fine.

The speakers were designed to accept input from an amplifier, but my current setup doesn't include a central amp. I decided to include my own amp as part of the speakers, and wanted to have Bluetooth or Wifi connectivity. Luckily enough, [Dayton Audio](https://www.parts-express.com/Dayton-Audio-WF60PA-60W-Class-D-Full-Range-2-Channel-Plate-Amplifier-with-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetoot-300-781?quantity=1&custcol_ava_item=300-781&custcol_ava_incomeaccount=General&custcol_ava_upccode=848791003547&custcol_ava_pickup=F&custcol_disableshopping=F) has a great plate amp that fit all my criteria!

# Bill of Materials 
With apologies to Paul...after putting all the electronics in a shopping cart, I realized I wasn't as committed to the wiring portion for this project. I happened to find a dirt-cheap set of JBL in-wall speakers on Amazon that looked to be close in range, size, etc. Each set includes a crossover so I'm just using that one.
